# Fin L/D Ratio vs Range & Velocity Decay (Reproducible EE Companion)

This repository is a reproducible companion to my aerodynamics investigation on how fin length-to-diameter ratio affects:
- horizontal range, and
- velocity decay (from high-speed video tracking).

## Quickstart
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/run_all.py
